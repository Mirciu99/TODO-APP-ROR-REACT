## Overview

This application is a full-stack web application combining the robust **Ruby on Rails** framework for the backend and **React** for the frontend. It is designed to perform **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** operations, demonstrating the power of integrating a traditional web framework with a modern JavaScript library. The UI is enhanced with **Bootstrap** components, ensuring a responsive and visually appealing interface.

## Key Features

- **CRUD Operations**: Enables users to create, read, update, and delete entries dynamically, facilitating interactive user experiences.

- **React Frontend**: Implements React to provide a responsive and interactive user interface, with Bootstrap for styling to ensure the UI is both functional and attractive.

- **Ruby on Rails Backend**: Utilizes Railsâ€™ robust structure and efficient handling of database operations, perfect for web applications requiring scalability and maintainability.

- **Database Migrations**: Manages database schema changes through Rails migrations, which help in maintaining a reliable database structure.

- **PostgreSQL Database**: Employs PostgreSQL, offering a powerful, open-source object-relational database system known for its reliability and data integrity.

## Interaction Between Frontend and Backend

The application ensures a smooth interaction between the frontend and backend using a cleanly defined API to handle data exchange in JSON format. This approach allows for effective separation of concerns, with React managing the state and presentation of user data and Rails handling data persistence and business logic.
